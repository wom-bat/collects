# Collects
This program works out the date in the Church Calendar used by the
Book of Common Prayer, and prints out the collect for that day, or the
previous Sunday.

Used without arguments it prints out next Sunday's date and collect,
ready for inclusion in orders-of-service.

## Dates
There are many different liturgical calendars in use.  This program
calculates according to the one in the Book of Common Prayer.

The year starts with the feast of Christ The King (five Sundays before
Christmas),  then the fours Sundays in Advent, then one or two Sundays
after Christmas, then Epiphany and some number of Sundays after that
until the feast of Septuagesima, 9 weeks before Easter.

After Easter, there are seven weeks up to Whitsunday/Pentecost; the
week after Whitsunday is Trinity Sunday, and all the other Sundays are
relative to Trinity Sunday.

I've added in a few 'special' dates: All Saints day, Christmas day,
etc.  There are many more that could be added, but most do not have
set prayers.
